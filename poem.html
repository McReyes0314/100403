        When I met you, I saw the ocean,  
        And slowly fell in deep emotion.  
        Your presence feels like home to me,  
        A place where I forever want to be.  

        The longing I once felt inside,  
        Began to fade when you arrived.  
        Our story may be hard to chart,  
        But itâ€™s something precious in my heart.
        </pre>

        <h1>02</h1>
        <pre>
        We don't know what tomorrow holds,
        But I promise that I'll always keep you close.
        We don't have forever in this lifetime,
        But memories we've shared make my heart glow.  

        Whatever happens, my love,  
        I will always hold your hand.  
        I will always be here beside you,  
        No matter what life has planned.
