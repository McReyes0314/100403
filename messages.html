        <p>
            Today is your special day, and I want to wish you a happy birthday. I want to start by thanking you for being born and for coming into my life. 
            I'm so grateful that I met you, that I know you, and that I love you. So many things have happened in the nearly three years we've been together,
            but you're still here beside me, and that’s something I will always treasure.
        </p>

        <h1>02</h1>
        <p>
            The road we’re on may not always be easy, but I'm willing to hold your hand as we face the challenges ahead. Our journey may be imperfect, 
            but it feels perfect when I'm with you. No matter what we face, let's take it slowly, supporting each other as we grow and better understand life together.
            I also want to take this moment to apologize if I’ve ever been unreasonable or hurt your feelings. 
            Please be patient with me when my mood is unpredictable, and I promise to do the same for you. 
            I will always understand and forgive because you are someone very special to me.
        </p>

                I'm wishing you a wonderful life where all the pieces come together and become clearer as time goes by. 
                May your dreams and aspirations come true. I’m always here to support and help you reach your goals.
            </p>
